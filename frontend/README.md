To start the frontend:

npm run dev

Tasks:

- [x] Bootstrap a frontend application with Next.js.
- [ ] Create a simple UI that makes it possible to create generated time series data (using your function from the API, e.g. via a simple button), and visualize it. Also: display previously recorded time series data as a list and optionally display CRUD operation buttons.

Bootstrap of the frontend completed and a very basic UI was created, but the frontend is not finished yet. 

Next steps:

- Send HTTP requests to the backend and retrieve data from the generated CSV.
- Visualize the data from the the CSV.
- Rework UI

Personal learnings:

Basics of next.js and how the routing is handled in next.js.

Things I want to look into next:

Building dynamic pages.
Linking frontend to backend and sending HTTP requests to the backend.
Visualizing data from different API's.
Trying to build a backend with next.js to compare it to nest.js
Creating modern looking and more complex UI's.
